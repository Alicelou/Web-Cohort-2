Web Dev Cohort 2 Exercises
==========================

Welcome to the exercise repo!

How to Complete Exercises
-------------------------

* *Fork* this **Repository** using the **Github UI** to create your own version of the **Repository**
* *Import* the **Repository** into **CodeSandbox**
* Go to your version of the **Repository** and create a new **Branch** for your submission
* Enter your answers into the .js file on that new **Branch** using **CodeSandbox**
* *Commit* and *Push* your changes to the file on the **Branch** you created
* ^^This is where we had some trouble last week - when you open the pull request make sure to select your repo from the dropdown (not mine!)
* Create a new **Pull Request** and tag the instructors for review
* Instructors will perform **Code Review** and approve your answers
* *Merge* your **Pull Request** into your **Main Branch** to complete the assignment
